# HotCommercialArea
a spatial data analysis course for urban-rural planning

 - This repository showcases the final project of a spatial data analysis course for urban-rural planning. 

 - The project aims to identify popular commercial districts in the main urban area of Guangzhou
   
   leveraging mobile signaling data and POI (Point of Interest) data.
   
   Using geopandas, we first perform spatial weight distribution of population data
   
   then allocate recreational OD (Origin-Destination) data extracted from mobile signaling based on POI density.
   
   Spatial autocorrelation analysis is subsequently applied to identify commercial districts.


 - The repository includes complete code files, datasets, and analysis reports

   demonstrating the practical application of spatial data analysis in urban-rural planning
   
   while providing a reference case template for related studies.


 - In the future, we plan to add social media comment crawling and analysis for the identified commercial districts to summarize their types and potential.
